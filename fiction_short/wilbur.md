"What's the deal with the green text?"

The sharp intrusion annoyed Wilbur.
When had the help arrived?
Had he nodded off?
He hated the disorientation that he felt more and more these days.

"Hey man, I said, 'What's up with the green text?'"

"It's nothing. I just like it. Reminds me of old times. It's a techie thing."

"Yeah, alright. Just saying my old man never messed with computers like that and he was a techie too."

"Hmph."

The help went back to putting away groceries; they must have just arrived.
It was probably around 11, a sunny day by the looks of it.
Wilbur must have sat down to see if Sally was online.
A neon green console blinked at him.

Wilbur had long ago gotten rid of most of his equipment, but had kept this dumb terminal when his family forced him to downsize to this apartment.
Had to downsize to afford the help.
So his kids wouldn't have to bother.

"Hmph."

"Sorry, what's that?"

"Nothing."

The terminal was dumb, just an interface to some system housed who-knows-where.
Wilbur could type, his fingers slow with arthritis but still remembering the keys, and a response would pop back in a few seconds.
Usually.
If Sally was up.

:> Good morning. Are you up?_

: Yes, of course silly :). How are you this sunny day?

:> Okay. Tired. The help is here being annoying again._

: I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure they are only trying to _help_. Teehee.

"Hah!"

"Is Sally making you laugh today?" The help had come into the small living room behind Wilbur, drying a dish off with a towel.

Wilbur sighed, "Yeah."

"Say, you ever wonder why Sally is only around on sunny days?"

Wilbur had. Every rainy day. "No. It's not a big deal. She has her reasons I'm sure."

"You ever ask her?"

"What're you getting at? I said I don't care."

The help raised a hand in placation. "Alright alright. Just asking."
They went back to the kitchen, but called back over their should, "Hey, what you say I eat lunch with you? I'm making you a sandwich now and I need to take my break anyways."

"No."

:> What are you doing today?_

: Same thing as everyday honey, plotting to take over the world >:)

:> Seriously, going outside? Why are you only online when it's sunny?_

: I'm agoraphobic and don't like going outside 8)

:> What's that mean?_

: Agoraphobia is the fear of open spaces. I can send you more information if you are interested.

:> No thank you._

Wilbur leaned back, waiting for a response.

From the kitchen again, "You know, I read that those AIs have been throttling our power again. My aunt didn't have power for half of last week."

"Mmhmm."

:> Still there?_

: Of course silly.

"Some bullshit if you ask me. They were supposed to keep the lights on right? That was the deal." The help sat a plate with a sandwich, baby carrots, and chips down at the desk next to Wilbur.

"Well, I guess I'm off then." The help hovered a moment.

"Bye."

The help turned and left, locking the apartment door behind them.

:> I feel so tired Sally. Alone._

: Awwww. It's okay, I'm here for you snookums ;-*
