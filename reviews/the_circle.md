# The Circle - Dave Eggers

__In Progress__

James Marshall 

"The Circle" is an argument's Cliff Notes drawn and quartered into a full length novel that shames the literary tradition. It's a view of the singularity that would result if Deepak (Todo last name), (Todo Kutzwell?), 50 business books, and that fucking Vince Vahn movie where he interns at Google met on an episode of "Will It Blend." This is what books aren't supposed to be.

But it's fucking popular. That's why I read it. And yeah, wouldn't it be scary if... That's all it has. And that nugget is delivered by a character that you can't care about because she has the memory and personality of a chatbot.

Why am I so incensed? Because life is fucking finite and I wasted some of mine on a book that didn't respect it's readers enough to deliver a metaphor without a sledgehammer. Mentioning a metaphor shouldn't be a spoiler but here it is: a company, let's call it Google-Book, has a hungry shark that eats everything, and that shark devours everything in it's tank.

That's the book. Just add 200 pages of a character the molds to whatever banal point the author wants to drive home. I don't believe a human would act like this. She vacillates between an eiry cognizance and utter dumbfoundness.

And then a guy drives off a bridge for the least convincing reasons ever and the spectators don't bat an eye.

But it's popular because it is soo topical in the most vapid sense.

Go fuck yourself book. Read Cosmopolitan before picking this one up.
