__In Progress__

Read Peter Watts.
I've only read two of his novels[^1], ["The Freeze Frame Revolution"](../brief_reviews/the_freeze_frame_revolution.md) being the other, but the only thing stopping me from reading more is A) the finite amount of time I have on this Earth and B) the fact that other excellent authors and books exist.

Blindsight is an argument: there is a central question that Watts is exploring through-out.

The near-future setting is recognizable, probably more so today than 2006 when it was published.
Babies are getting Gattaca-ed (TODO: footnote), folks are Deus Ex-ing themselves with all sorts of augments, and, just FYI: vampires are a thing. Real vampires.

How good is Blindsight?
The existance of vampires, while perhaps a bit off-putting at first, actually works.
Really well.
Hard sci-fi with blood sucking monster of myth and it totally works.



TODO: Footnote: Gattaca came out in 1997!

[^1]: I have since read "Starfish". Would also recommend: it is good, just not as good as Freeze Frame and Blindsight.
