Credit to Denis Johnson: while the old side of middle-aged male protagonist's story arc does depend on the aid of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, the protagonist doesn't fuck her. He comes really close, but doesn't actually.

It's just hard to read this story and not feel a bit grossed out. The protagonist is a college professor, and his pixie helper is a student. His tragedy and her maturity don't really do anything to ameliorate the ick factor.

The book is fine. Old guy is side and doesn't have a purpose. By the end he has a purpose thanks to meeting a women that manages to remind him of both his wife and daughter (both deceased). You could read a lot worse, but you could also read a lot better.
