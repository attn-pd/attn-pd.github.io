Still reading this one... but god damn it if it is yet another middle-aged old dude who fucks a younger woman.

Thankfully that wasn't the case, but he came close.

It was well written and interesting, but ultimately I just don't get the need for a magical, mysterious pixie to save some old dude from his midlife crisis (okay, a bit more tragic than that).
