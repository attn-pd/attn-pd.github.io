Hard sci-fi has a problem: the distances between interesting things in the galaxy are too large and the speed of light is too slow for humans to traverse.
So your tale must either stay within our solar system (such as in "The Expanse") or some physics as we know it conceit must be made (your wormholes, subspace travel, warp speed, etc.).

Peter Watts uses extremely long periods of hibernation to allow the characters to travel great distances in their lifetimes.
How does the crew maintain continuity between their centuries long naps and rotating shifts?
Who gets to wake up and when?
How does the ship deal with such a crew, especially if they get unruly?

The Freeze Frame Revolution is a great book; the implications of hibernation are just a small part of it.
Add it to your reading list.

I strongly suggest getting a physical copy.
The graphic design fits well with the story and it is the first book I've read with a genuinely rewarding easter egg hidden in the pages.
