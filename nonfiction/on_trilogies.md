Not sure there is a whole... article? here, but maybe something on good trilogies vs ones that should have stayed a one off.

The Broken Earth series: Great.

Hypeirion: great view from inside the empire. Are we the baddies? Yes, yes we are.

Ender's Game: Good, no need to read on for the space catholics (space catholics worked well in Hyperion tho. 

Annilation? Great... next two books felt like a cover of the first but soo drawn out.
