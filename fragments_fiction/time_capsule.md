"I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?" Dr. Taylor was not accustomed to being stumped.
Rarely had it happened during his time earning an astrophysics PhD, and it happened even less in his current position: principal investigator for NASA's most advanced planet hunter yet.

But here he was, stalling for time, because a 10th grader had asked a questioned that he had simply never considered.

The young woman snapped her gum and repeated, "Is it bad. 'Stealing momentum' from our planets?"

"Well, no, the satellite is so small, relatively speaking, that the slingshot maneuver has an imperceptibly small affect on the planet."

"But it slows it down right? The planet."

"Technically yes, but it is a very small amount."

Another student who, unlike most at this point, had been following with interest, pitched it, "And you said in space that slowing down is like falling."

"That is correct, as an orbiting body, a satellite, slows, its orbit will become lower at the opposing point until the perigee intersects with the body being..."

"Right," a third student in the back row broke in, "and the Earth orbits the sun. So when you slingshot to speed up your satellite, you are making us fall into the sun. At least a little."

Taylor looked to the teacher; she seemed to be thoroughly enjoying her students having a different target to pillory with questions for a change. "Their logic seems on point Dr. Taylor."

He collected himself, took a depth breath, and re-framed the question. It was a good one, but the students where missing the _scale_ of it all.

"Okay, so imagine I'm Lex Luthor..."

"Who?"

"A bad guy. Superhero movie villain, right?"

A few nods.

"And my plan is to plunge the Earth into the Sun by launching rockets and using slingshot maneuvers to slow the Earth's orbit. I would need to figure out just how many rockets to launch with how big of payloads and how fast to accelerate the payloads and so on, right?

Don't worry, I'm not going to make you do the math. But you get what I'm saying, right? You could figure it all out." Taylor got a few nods from his inquisitors. "Right, so here's the thing: the Earth is so massive that I would need to launch all of Texas before our year lost a second. Roughly."

It seemed like they ....

The class wraps up with a student making a joke that hey, at least you launched Texas into deep space.

This is all exposition for the main store: Taylor's team spots a planet that seems to have recently had a major shortening of its orbital period. They figure out that the only realistic explanation is that the planet is being used for MASSIVE slingshot maneuvers. The rest is just figuring out what that could mean (like a mass migration or invasion)...
