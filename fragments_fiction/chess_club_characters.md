Two old men sit opposed.
One, we'll call Frank, sits with a grin, just happy to be there pushing pieces and listening.
The other, we'll call him Ponce (short for pontificate) is more than happy to give Frank something to listen to.
Ponce goes on about the latest drama with the grand masters: the cheating scandal.
Which of course leads him to Carlson and how just dominant he is, and the weird openings he will play sometimes and even if it puts him in a bad position he can still win because he is so dominant and here, let me show you one of his favorites it will just take a minute and can you imagine that? it reminds of some other master who playing in the I don't know what century who said some witty quip that I'm butchering but that isn't really the point I was getting at now is it?
Frank smiles and nods and Ponce goes on.

I'm sitting beside Ponce, across from me is Tobias, who played his first game too cocky and with a blind-spot for knights.
Now he's taking it more seriously, taking more time the worst his position gets.
He's shaking his head, presumably dismissing another doomed scheme, his long bangs sweeping side to side.
Later his brother arrives to side beside him and offer hints like "you can still win" and "just play it already."
They banter back and forth while I sit and ponder my empty glass more than the position.
I offered a draw just to end things but Tobias seemed content to squander pawns and be antagonized by his brother.

Meanwhile the Eagles fan is talking to somebody, everybody, and stops by our table.
He sees us playing and acts surprised that folks are playing chess.
It's at that moment he looks around and sees the half dozen or so games going on.
He's nice enough, repeats himself a lot, and seems to be under the impression that folks that play chess are smart.
He lets us know that we must be smart for playing chess.
Then he miss-genders Tobias, makes it worse by apologizing at length, and goes back to telling us how he's going to go down to the TGI Friday's to watch the game and how all of the Commanders fans are going to just hate him for wearing his Eagles hat and jacket.
Another chess player, a big guy who seems a little off, asks the Eagles fan for some money to buy dinner before the grocery store closes and the Eagles fan hands over some cash and tells the big guy to be safe.
The Eagles fan tells us that the big guy is a little off.

The Eagles fan finally heads out to watch the Eagles lose at the TGI Friday's leaving Frank watching Tobias and I play.
Frank had been talking to the Eagles fan, mostly just listening, just happy to be there.
